# KYZEN code challenge

All contents of this repository were created as a response to KYZEN's coding challenge.


Wireframe designs can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/Vu5ap2a8AdQ3igWGTKRl4D/KYZEN-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1)

Two designs were created based on the possible needs of the customer.

## Design one

A tablet design with modals, made with engineers in mind, only displays desired data when selected. Not only are users less likely to become overwhelemed by excessive information, they will also be able to view important measurements at a distance.


## Design Two

More of a dashboard display, design two fits all relevant data on one screen, so users can see what they need without navigation.

This design is intended for desktop view, but can also be implemented on tablets if desired by the customer.
